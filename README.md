# wal-rs
wal-rs is a rust CLI I made to keep a consistent theme with both my desktop wallpaper and RGB peripherals (mouse and keyboard). It searches for a JSON file at ```~/.cache/wal/colors.json```to load 16 colors generated by pywal that you can choose from that will set the KBM RGB to the selected color.

**Note:** This script has only been tested using Logitech devices on Linux. For Windows use the G Hub software.

### Dependencies
  - pywal
  - g810-led
  - ratbagctl
